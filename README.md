Filter Effects
==============

An example application demonstrating the use of the different filters of Imaging
SDK with camera photos. This example app uses the camera and displays the
viewfinder for taking a picture. The taken photo is then processed with the
predefined filters. The filter properties can be manipulated and the changes can
be seen in the preview image immediately. The processed image can be saved in
JPEG format to the device. You can also select an existing photo and apply an
effect to it. 

Two versions of this example are currently available:

* The universal version of the app, which can be build for and run in Windows
  Phone 8.1, Windows RT 8.1 and Windows 8.1 environments is located in
  `FilterEffects81` folder.
* The older version, with separate code projects, supporting Windows Phone 8.0
  and Windows RT 8.1 is located in `FilterEffectsWP80` folder.
